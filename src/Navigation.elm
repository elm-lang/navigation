{-| This is a library for managing browser navigation yourself.

The core functionality is the ability to &ldquo;navigate&rdquo; to new URLs,
changing the address bar of the browser *without* the browser kicking off a
request to your servers. Instead, you manage the changes yourself in Elm.

{-| Same as [`Html.program`][doc], but your `update` function gets messages
whenever the URL changes.

[doc]: http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/html/latest/Html#program

The first difference is the `Location -> msg` argument. This converts a
[`Location`](#location) into a message whenever the URL changes. That message
is fed into your `update` function just like any other one.

The second difference is that the `init` function takes `Location` as an
argument. This lets you use the URL on the first frame.

**Note:** A location message is produced every time the URL changes. This
includes things exposed by this library, like `back` and `newUrl`, as well as
whenever the user clicks the back or forward buttons of the browsers. So if
the URL changes, you will hear about it in your `update` function.

-- TIME TRAVEL


{-| Go back some number of pages. So `back 1` goes back one page, and `back 2`
goes back two pages.

**Note:** You only manage the browser history that *you* created. Think of this
library as letting you have access to a small part of the overall history. So
if you go back farther than the history you own, you will just go back to some
other website!
-}
back : Int -> Cmd msg
back n =
  command (Jump -n)


{-| Go forward some number of pages. So `forward 1` goes forward one page, and
`forward 2` goes forward two pages. If there are no more pages in the future,
this will do nothing.

**Note:** You only manage the browser history that *you* created. Think of this
library as letting you have access to a small part of the overall history. So
if you go forward farther than the history you own, the user will end up on
whatever website they visited next!
-}
forward : Int -> Cmd msg
forward n =
  command (Jump n)


{-| Leave the current page and load the given URL. **This always results in a
page load**, even if the provided URL is the same as the current one.

    load "http://elm-lang.org"

Use [`newUrl`](#newUrl) and [`modifyUrl`](#modifyUrl) if you want to change
the URL without a page load.
-}
load : String -> Cmd msg
load url =
  command (Visit url)


{-| Reload the current page. **This always results in a page load!**
This may grab resources from the browser cache, so use
[`reloadAndSkipCache`](reloadAndSkipCache) if you want to be sure
that you are not loading any cached resources.
-}
reload : Cmd msg
reload =
  command (Reload False)


{-| Reload the current page without using the browser cache. **This always
results in a page load!** It is more common to want [`reload`](reload).
-}
reloadAndSkipCache : Cmd msg
reloadAndSkipCache =
  command (Reload True)



-- CHANGE HISTORY


{-| Step to a new URL. This will add a new entry to the browser history.

**Note:** If the user has gone `back` a few pages, there will be &ldquo;future
pages&rdquo; that the user can go `forward` to. Adding a new URL in that
scenario will clear out any future pages. It is like going back in time and
making a different choice.
-}
newUrl : String -> Cmd msg
newUrl url =
  command (New url)


{-| Modify the current URL. This *will not* add a new entry to the browser
history. It just changes the one you are on right now.
-}
modifyUrl : String -> Cmd msg
modifyUrl url =
  command (Modify url)



-- LOCATION


{-| A bunch of information about the address bar.

**Note 1:** Almost everyone will want to use a URL parsing library like
[`evancz/url-parser`][parse] to turn a `Location` into something more useful
in your `update` function.

[parse]: https://github.com/evancz/url-parser

**Note 2:** These fields correspond exactly with the fields of `document.location`
as described [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Location).
